# Getting Started with Pyrite

Pyrite is a tool for creating large Minecraft Bedrock command files with ease.
First, [download Pyrite](htpps://solarflurry.github.io/pyrite/download) if you have not already.

The first thing to understand about Pyrite is the `select` function. The select function selects an entity for resulting commands. The following code utilises `select`.
```select(@a).say("Hello World!")```
The code above reference all players (`@a`) and runs the `say`x function.
